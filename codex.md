# AI workflow rules

## Branches
- NEVER commit or push directly to main.
- Always create a feature branch and open a PR.

## Shared core rule
This project uses a separate shared core repository.

If a change creates reusable logic, patterns, utilities, styles, prompts, schemas, UX rules, or documentation that can benefit other apps:
- DO NOT leave it only in this repo.
- Add it to the shared core repo too.
- Mention in the PR what was moved or copied to core.

Examples of things that belong in core:
- reusable components
- shared CSS patterns
- exercise logic
- scoring/progress logic
- prompt templates
- UX rules
- database conventions
- naming conventions
- deployment notes

Examples of things that stay local:
- app-specific copy
- app-specific branding
- app-specific routes
- app-specific data
- one-off fixes

Before finishing, check:
- Did this change include anything reusable?
- If yes, was it added to core?
